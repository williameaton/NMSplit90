Splitting functions
- Elastic tensor 
- Gauss integral 

Utilities
- Rotate tensor XYZ --> RTP 
  --> we have RTP to XYZ so invert? 
- Gauss integration - weights, jacobians from specfem etc



Strain
- Trace occassional error? 


Testing
- Check xyz -> rtp of coordinates 


Visual 
- Allow output of single mode
