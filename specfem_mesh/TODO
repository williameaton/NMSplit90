Anisotropy: 
- Write faster version for the M C M^T given that 
  C in natural coordinates is 6 x 6 but only the upper left 3 x 3 will be 0
  because we are not dealing with shear (L = N = 0)

Splitting functions
- Elastic tensor 
- Rotation matrix 2 ways: 
  1) SEM method -- D.36 -- what we would use going forwards
  2) D.68 -- theory-based method to benchmark case 1


Toroidal modes: 
  - Loaded & Normalised correctly (1)
  - Strain being computed correctly
  - Displacement being computed correctly
  - Spline interpolation?


Testing
- Fully setup Wj3 
- Fully setup bond_matrix 



Visual 
- IMPORTANT: Strain is now stored in voigt ordering -- check ordering in ensight save 
  as it may thing 4 -> 12 (XY) rather than 23 (YZ) etc
