Splitting functions
- Elastic tensor 
- Rotation matrix 2 ways: 
  1) SEM method -- D.36 -- what we would use going forwards
  2) D.68 -- theory-based method to benchmark case 1


Toroidal modes: 
  - Loaded & Normalised correctly (1)
  - Strain being computed correctly
  - Displacement being computed correctly
  - Spline interpolation?


Utilities
- Rotate tensor XYZ --> RTP 
  --> we have RTP to XYZ so invert? 

Strain
- Trace occassional error? 

Testing
- Check xyz -> rtp of coordinates 
- Lagrange
- Legendre
